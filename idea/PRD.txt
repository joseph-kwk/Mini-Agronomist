🌱 Mini Agronomist – PRD v1.1
1. Objective
Build a lightweight, offline web app to help small-scale farmers predict crop yield and receive actionable planting advice based on soil type, rainfall, crop selection, and planting date—without server dependency.

2. Core Features
a. User Input Interface
Dropdowns

Soil Type (e.g., Clay, Sandy, Loamy)

Crop Type (e.g., Maize, Groundnuts, Sorghum)

Numeric Input

Rainfall Estimate (mm/week)

Date Picker

Planting Date

(Optional) Region (for future scaling)

b. Prediction Logic
Rules-Based Engine using heuristics derived from agronomy tables

E.g.: If Crop = Maize + Soil = Loam + Rainfall = 60–90mm → Yield ≈ 3.5–5 tons/ha

All logic written in Vanilla JavaScript—fully client-side

No external data calls; models defined in static JSON or JS objects

c. Output and Visuals
Yield Prediction (e.g. “Expected Yield: 4.2 tons/ha”)

Planting Tip (e.g. “Fertilize during week 3–5 with nitrogen-rich compost.”)

Risk Level Bar (SVG-based, changes color based on prediction reliability or rainfall adequacy)

(Optional) Add icon cues for clarity (from Google Material Icons)

d. Offline-First Deployment
Packaged as a Progressive Web App (PWA):

Installable

Runs offline via browser caching

No server or database needed

3. Tech Stack & Tools
Layer	Tools
Interface	HTML + CSS
Logic Engine	Vanilla JavaScript
Visualization	Inline SVG (for yield bars & status cues)
Icons	Google Material Icons (local fallback)
Testing	Chrome DevTools, optional Python/Live Server
Packaging	Service Workers + manifest.json for PWA
4. Stretch Goals
Save user preferences in localStorage

Allow CSV input for soil test data (V2)

Integrate a mini version of the Three Circles Algorithm for matching conditions to crop suitability
