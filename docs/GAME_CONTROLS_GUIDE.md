## 🌱 Complete Farming Cycle

### 1. **Plow the Field** 🚜
- Drive tractor near an empty plot
- Press **P** to plow
- **Why?** Plowing loosens compacted soil, improves drainage, and allows roots to penetrate deeper
- **Learning**: Soil structure affects water infiltration and root growth

### 2. **Sow Seeds** 🌾
- Select a plowed plot
- Press **O** to plant (costs $100)
- **Why?** Proper planting depth and spacing ensures optimal germination
- **Learning**: Different crops need different planting conditions

### 3. **Monitor Growth** 📈
- Watch crops grow through visual stages:
  - **Seedling** (Days 1-20): Light green, small
  - **Vegetative** (Days 21-60): Dark green, growing
  - **Flowering** (Days 61-80): Yellow-green
  - **Mature** (Days 81-90): Golden, ready to harvest

### 4. **Water Management** 💧
- Press **I** to water plots
- Check moisture levels (click plot)
- Watch for rain (natural irrigation)
- **Why?** Crops need consistent moisture
- **Learning**: Too little = drought stress; too much = root rot

### 5. **Harvest** 🌾
- When crops turn golden, press **H**
- Earn money based on yield
- **Learning**: Yield depends on soil moisture, quality, and management
